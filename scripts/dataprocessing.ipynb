       "1. Analyze heap dumps using Chrome DevTools:\n",
       "\n",
       "Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`. Click on \"Load profile\" under the \"Memory\" tab and load the heap snapshots you collected. You can now analyze the snapshots using the following views:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Summary: Provides a high-level overview of memory allocation, grouped by constructor name.\n",
       "* Comparison: Allows you to compare two heap snapshots and identify objects that have been created and not garbage collected between them.\n",
       "* Containment: Shows the object hierarchy and how objects are connected.\n",
       "* Statistics: Displays memory usage statistics by object category.\n",
       "1. Identify memory leaks:\n",
       "\n",
       "To identify memory leaks, focus on the \"Comparison\" view, which shows the difference between the two snapshots. Look for objects with a high number of allocations that haven't been garbage collected. This can indicate a memory leak.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Inspect references:\n",
       "\n",
       "Once you've identified potential memory leaks, inspect the references to those objects using the \"Containment\" view. This can help you understand why these objects are still being retained in memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Find and fix the root cause:\n",

Here is a step-by-step guide for this process:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Gather necessary tools:\n",
       "   - Heap dumps from your Node.js server: We assume that you have already collected heap dumps while running your application with the \"Node Inspector API\" or a tool like \"remotedebug\" or \"nddump.\"\n",
       "   - A Node.js heap analysis tool: We recommend using tools like Node Heap Snapshot Analyzer (HSA) from Google or Node-Inspector memory plugin. In this example, we will use the Node Heap Snapshot Analyzer (HSA) as the analysis tool.\n",
       "   - A text editor or IDE with debugger support for JavaScript (e.g., VS Code with NodeJS Debugger).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Install Node Heap Snapshot Analyzer (HSA):\n",
       "   - Install the `node-heap-snapshot-analyzer` package using `npm` or `yarn`:\n",
       "     - NPM: `npm install -g node-heap-snapshot-analyzer`\n",
       "     - Yarn: `yarn global add node-heap-snapshot-analyzer`\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Analyze the first heap dump:\n",
       "   - Open the terminal in the same directory as the heap dump file.\n",
       "   - Run the following command to analyze the heap dump:\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "     hsa app.js:47576 heap.hidump\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "     Replace \"app.js:47576\" with the path and process ID of your heap dump file (users/my_user/heap_dumps/47576_heapdump.zip or similar).\n",
       "   - The HSA command will generate a HTML report in the current directory named \"report-app.js-47576\". Open this report in your web browser.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Inspect the memory usage and allocation:\n",
       "   - Once the in-depth report is loaded, open the \"Tree Top Hierarchy\" tab. It visualizes memory allocation and will guide you to identify where significant memory has been allocated by counting the corresponding row's percentage in relation to the total heap memory usage.\n",
       "   - Clicking a specific row within the table will show more details about the object on the right-hand side of the report (e.g., constructor, size, and inherited shared data).\n",
       "   - Compare this first heap dump's results with the next heap dump to identify whether the memory usage is increasing significantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Inspect growth between heap dumps:\n",
       "   - To analyze the growth between two heap dumps, take the following steps:\n",
       "     - Make sure you have two heap dumps captured using \"heap --snapshot\" command, first at the start of your program and then when you suspect memory leak to occur (e.g., heap_start.hsydump &amp; heap_end.hsydump).\n",
       "     - Run HSA analysis as described in step 3 for both heap dumps (hsa app.js:47576 heap_start.hsydump and hsa app.js:47576 heap_end.hsydump).\n",
       "     - Open both report HTML files (report-app.js-47576-heap_start.html &amp; report-app.js-47576-heap_end.html) in separate tabs in your web browser.\n",
       "     - Inspect the \"Tree Top Hierarchy\" tab for both reports, finding the objects with the highest growth in their allocation.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Locate the potential memory leak:\n",
       "   - In the Object Detail section on the right, click on individual objects and check their references, properties, or event listeners, which might be leading to unexpected memory consumption.\n",
       "   - Double-check released memory by manually running `gc` in the Node.js REPL and observing memory recovery. Verify whether the problematic portion of memory is still held by the application after the garbage collection runs.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Debug and resolve the memory leak:\n",
       "   - After narrowing down the specific location or method that's causing the memory leak, open your application's code in the text editor or IDE mentioned earlier.\n",
       "   - Set up a Nodejs debugger and set breakpoints in the problematic methods. Then, use tools like Visual Studio Code's built-in debugger or Chrome DevTools debugger for Node.js to trigger these methods during execution and examine all variables and properties.\n",

However, using heap dumps can significantly simplify the process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to debug a memory leak using heap dumps:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Install necessary tools:\n",
       "\n",
       "To analyze the heap dumps, you'll need the `heapdump` module to generate the dumps and `chrome-devtools-frontend` to visualize and inspect them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Install the `heapdump` module:\n",
       "```bash\n",
       "npm install heapdump\n",
       "```\n",
       "1. Generate heap dumps:\n",
       "\n",
       "Include the `heapdump` module in your server application and set up a way to trigger the heap dump, either on a certain condition or via an API endpoint. For example, you can add the following code to create an endpoint to generate a heap dump:\n",
       "```javascript\n",
       "const heapdump = require('heapdump');\n",
       "const http = require('http');\n",
       "\n",
       "http.createServer((req, res) => {\n",
       "  if (req.url === '/heapdump') {\n",
       "    const file = `/path/to/dumps/heapdump-${Date.now()}.heapsnapshot`;\n",
       "    heapdump.writeSnapshot(file, (err, filename) => {\n",
       "      if (err) {\n",
       "        console.error(err);\n",
       "        res.statusCode = 500;\n",
       "        res.end('Error generating heap dump');\n",

       "  }\n",
       "}).listen(3000);\n",
       "```\n",
       "Now, you can generate heap dumps by hitting the `/heapdump` endpoint.\n",

       "1. Collect heap dumps:\n",
       "\n",
       "Collect at least two heap dumps: one when the server starts and one after the memory leak occurs. This will help you compare the memory state at different points in time.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Analyze heap dumps using Chrome DevTools:\n",
       "\n",
       "Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`. Click on \"Load profile\" under the \"Memory\" tab and load the heap snapshots you collected. You can now analyze the snapshots using the following views:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Summary: Provides a high-level overview of memory allocation, grouped by constructor name.\n",
       "* Comparison: Allows you to compare two heap snapshots and identify objects that have been created and not garbage collected between them.\n",
       "* Containment: Shows the object hierarchy and how objects are connected.\n",
       "* Statistics: Displays memory usage statistics by object category.\n",
       "1. Identify memory leaks:\n",
       "\n",
       "To identify memory leaks, focus on the \"Comparison\" view, which shows the difference between the two snapshots. Look for objects with a high number of allocations that haven't been garbage collected. This can indicate a memory leak.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Inspect references:\n",
       "\n",
       "Once you've identified potential memory leaks, inspect the references to those objects using the \"Containment\" view. This can help you understand why these objects are still being retained in memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Find and fix the root cause:\n",
       "\n",
       "Now that you've identified the leaking objects and their references, you can trace back to the code causing the leak. Once you've found the root cause, fix the issue and restart your server.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Verify the fix:\n",
       "\n",
       "After fixing the issue, repeat steps 2-6 to generate new heap dumps and compare them to verify that the memory leak has been resolved. If the issue persists, continue debugging until the memory leak is no longer present.\n",
       "\n",

       "I have a couple heap dumps, explain how to debug this step by step.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Debugging a memory leak in a Node.js server application using heap dumps involves analyzing the collected data to identify and fix the source of the memory leak. Here is a step-by-step guide for this process:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Gather necessary tools:\n",
       "   - Heap dumps from your Node.js server: We assume that you have already collected heap dumps while running your application with the \"Node Inspector API\" or a tool like \"remotedebug\" or \"nddump.\"\n",
       "   - A Node.js heap analysis tool: We recommend using tools like Node Heap Snapshot Analyzer (HSA) from Google or Node-Inspector memory plugin. In this example, we will use the Node Heap Snapshot Analyzer (HSA) as the analysis tool.\n",
       "   - A text editor or IDE with debugger support for JavaScript (e.g., VS Code with NodeJS Debugger).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Install Node Heap Snapshot Analyzer (HSA):\n",
       "   - Install the `node-heap-snapshot-analyzer` package using `npm` or `yarn`:\n",
       "     - NPM: `npm install -g node-heap-snapshot-analyzer`\n",
       "     - Yarn: `yarn global add node-heap-snapshot-analyzer`\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Analyze the first heap dump:\n",
       "   - Open the terminal in the same directory as the heap dump file.\n",
       "   - Run the following command to analyze the heap dump:\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "     hsa app.js:47576 heap.hidump\n",
       "     ```\n",
       "     Replace \"app.js:47576\" with the path and process ID of your heap dump file (users/my_user/heap_dumps/47576_heapdump.zip or similar).\n",
       "   - The HSA command will generate a HTML report in the current directory named \"report-app.js-47576\". Open this report in your web browser.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Inspect the memory usage and allocation:\n",
       "   - Once the in-depth report is loaded, open the \"Tree Top Hierarchy\" tab. It visualizes memory allocation and will guide you to identify where significant memory has been allocated by counting the corresponding row's percentage in relation to the total heap memory usage.\n",
       "   - Clicking a specific row within the table will show more details about the object on the right-hand side of the report (e.g., constructor, size, and inherited shared data).\n",
       "   - Compare this first heap dump's results with the next heap dump to identify whether the memory usage is increasing significantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Inspect growth between heap dumps:\n",
       "   - To analyze the growth between two heap dumps, take the following steps:\n",
       "     - Make sure you have two heap dumps captured using \"heap --snapshot\" command, first at the start of your program and then when you suspect memory leak to occur (e.g., heap_start.hsydump & heap_end.hsydump).\n",
       "     - Run HSA analysis as described in step 3 for both heap dumps (hsa app.js:47576 heap_start.hsydump and hsa app.js:47576 heap_end.hsydump).\n",
       "     - Open both report HTML files (report-app.js-47576-heap_start.html & report-app.js-47576-heap_end.html) in separate tabs in your web browser.\n",
       "     - Inspect the \"Tree Top Hierarchy\" tab for both reports, finding the objects with the highest growth in their allocation.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Locate the potential memory leak:\n",
       "   - In the Object Detail section on the right, click on individual objects and check their references, properties, or event listeners, which might be leading to unexpected memory consumption.\n",
       "   - Double-check released memory by manually running `gc` in the Node.js REPL and observing memory recovery. Verify whether the problematic portion of memory is still held by the application after the garbage collection runs.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Debug and resolve the memory leak:\n",
       "   - After narrowing down the specific location or method that's causing the memory leak, open your application's code in the text editor or IDE mentioned earlier.\n",

This is due to several factors, including size, weight of materials used, and seating capacity. On average, a car can weigh between 3,000 to 5,000 pounds (1,360 to 2,270 kilograms) depending on its make and model. On the other hand, a standard city bus can weigh between 25,000 to 40,000 pounds (11,340 to 18,144 kilograms). This difference in weight is primarily due to the larger size and increased passenger capacity of a bus, which requires stronger materials and additional support systems for structural integrity and safety.   \n",

       "4  I understand that you'd like a code function that would help you find the three least common values from a given list within a specified range and also display their frequencies. Here's a Python code snippet that includes a reusable function to assist you with that:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections import Counter\\n\\ndef least_common_values(numbers, lower_limit, upper_limit, count):\\n    filtered_numbers = [n for n in numbers if lower_limit <= n <= upper_limit]\\n    frequency = Counter(filtered_numbers)\\n    least_common = frequency.most_common()[::-1][:count]\\n\\n    return least_common\\n\\n# Example usage\\nnumbers = [9, 11, 8, 7, 12, 9, 11, 7, 8, 11, 7, 12, 8, 10, 7, 12, 9]\\nlower_limit = 7\\nupper_limit = 12\\ncount = 3\\n\\nresult = least_common_values(numbers, lower_limit, upper_limit, count)\\n\\n# Print the table\\nprint(\"Value | Frequency\")\\nprint(\"------+-----------\")\\nfor value, frequency in result:\\n    print(f\"{value:5} | {frequency:9}\")\\n```\\n\\nThe reusable function is `least_common_values(numbers, lower_limit, upper_limit, count)`, where you pass the given list, lower and upper limits, and the number of values you'd like to display. This function returns the requested least common values, and then the table is printed with the values in ascending order and their frequencies in descending order.\\n\\nYou can modify the `numbers`, `lower_limit`, `upper_limit`, and `count` variables according to your requirements, and the code will return the desired output.   \n",

       "      <td>An eight-year-old boy has left doctors baffled after his hands swelled to giant proportions and now weigh more than two stone. Young Kaleem, from India, is unable to carry out simple tasks, including tying his own shoe laces, after he was born with hands twice the size of an average baby. His mother Haleema, 27, said she knew he was different at birth but was powerless to help and the youngster's hands have now grown so large they measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the end of his middle finger. Scroll down for video. Kaleem, from India, was born with hands twice the size of an average baby and they have continued to grow. His hands now measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the tip of his middle finger and weigh two stone. The eight-year-old claims he is bullied because of his giant hands and has difficulty performing simple tasks. The cricket fan said he has been bullied and shunned most of his life because others are 'scared' of his deformity. He said: 'I do not go to school because the teacher says other kids are scared of my hands. 'Many of them used to bully me for my deformity. They would say \"let's beat up the kid with the large hands\". 'Some of them have actually beaten me and would go after me often. 'I find it difficult to put on my clothes, button my shirt and pull up my pants. 'But I don't know if I want doctors to operate on my hands. They would have to make me unconscious and then they would cut me open. 'I have no problem if they could do it without an injection. A small operation would be okay.' His parents, who earn just £15 a month, have been desperately trying to find help for their son - but to no avail. His mother Haleema, 27, (pictured with Kaleem and another one of her children) said she feels 'powerless' Kaleem, a keen cricketer, said the teachers at his school have told him other children are 'scared' of his hands. He has found it difficulty to play cricket and hold a bat due to his condition but tries to still join in with his friends. His mother, who has other children who do not suffer from the same condition, said: 'When Kaleem was born his hand was twice the size of a normal baby's. 'His hands were big and his fingers were long. Initially his fists were small but they began to grow large as well and his fingers also kept growing.' His father, Shamim, 45, who works as a labourer, is worried his son will never be independent and blames himself for not earning enough money. 'He has difficulty feeding himself because his fist does not bend properly - so we have to feed him,' he said. 'Using two fingers he is able to pick up some things like a glass of water to drink. 'We want to take him to the hospital but there have been times when money has been so low that my wife has been forced to go begging. 'In that kind of financial situation, getting treatment for Kaleem was difficult. 'Even when I tried to get Kaleem into the school, the headmaster told me to put in writing that the school would not be responsible if the other children were afraid of his hands or bullied him or laughed at him.' Doctors in India have been left baffled by his growing hands and many are at a loss as to what the condition is. The youngster has difficulty eating, tying his shoelaces and carrying out other basic tasks due to his  hands. Kaleem's father Shamim, 45, (pictured together above) is worried his son will never become independent. The couple have only just been able to take their son to a local doctor for an assessment but their hopes of an instant cure have been dashed. Dr Ratan, the director of the local hospital, said: 'As far as my knowledge goes, this is an extremely rare condition. 'I have not seen a case in medical journals or on the internet where only the hands grew to such a large size. 'Until we have done proper genetic testing we will not be able to say exactly what is causing this deformity.' He said that apart from the unsightly growths, Kaleem is in good health - with properly functioning lungs and heart. Doctors have assessed Kaleem and have described his hands as a 'rare condition'. He is otherwise healthy. Kaleem was born with larger-than-average hands but they have continued to grow throughout his childhood. But as his hands continue to grow it may put increased pressure on his cardiovascular system, potentially shortening his life. Elsewhere, Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at the state-of-the-art Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, near Delhi, has also been left baffled after reviewing photographs and videos of the boy's hands. However, he believes Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma or hamartoma - which are both treatable. He added: 'This condition looks very rare and I have come across something like this before. Without proper examination and medical tests I am not 100 per cent sure about what this is.' Kaleem's parents are now hoping to raise money for their son in the hope that his condition can be treated. One doctor said he believes the Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma - a condition of the lymphatic system causing extreme inflamation - or hamartoma - a benign tumour - both of which are treatable. Lymphangioma is a condition of the lymphatic system which causes extreme inflammation resulting in doughy masses forming in certain parts of the body. Hamartoma is a benign type of tumour where the body produces excess tissue. After hearing from the doctors, Kaleem's parents now have renewed optimism that something can be done for their son and are doubling their efforts to raise money for him. 'We have tried several places with no solutions so far,' said Shamim. 'But I have a feeling there is a way to get the resources to give my son a normal life.'\\nSummarize the highlights of this article.</td>\n",

Demand for fresh and packaged goods declined, impacting both small and large food companies, and forcing many to temporarily close or scale back operations. There was also an increased emphasis on ethical sourcing and transparency, as consumers looked for assurances that their food was sourced responsibly and produced sustainably.

His hands are so big that they now weigh over two stone and he has trouble doing simple tasks like tying his shoelaces or eating. His hands measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the end of his middle finger. Kaleem's parents don't earn much money, so they are trying to raise funds to get the proper treatment for their son. Some doctors think he might have a condition called lymphangioma or hamartoma, which could be treatable.   \n",
       "4  In 2020, the food industry faced numerous changes due to the ongoing global pandemic, including changes in consumer behavior, production cuts, and disruptions in supply chains. As a result, there was a lot of volatility within the industry as businesses struggled to adjust to the new reality. Demand for fresh and packaged goods declined, impacting both small and large food companies, and forcing many to temporarily close or scale back operations. There was also an increased emphasis on ethical sourcing and transparency, as consumers looked for assurances that their food was sourced responsibly and produced sustainably. In addition, there was an overall shift away from traditionally produced foods towards healthier, more natural alternatives. Overall, 2020 was a tumultuous year for the food industry, but it also presented many opportunities for those able to adapt to the changing marketplace.   \n",

Text analysis and summarization involve using NLP to help to extract important information from text, analyze it, and present it in a more understandable way. Machine translation utilizes NLP to translate text from one language to another. Finally, dialog systems use NLP to enable chatbots to interact with people in natural language.   \n",

Furthermore, these effects are already causing an increase in poverty, hunger, and sparking global health crises. The effects of climate change are set to worsen in the coming decades, with the potential of a considerable amount of irreversible damage if drastic action is not taken.   \n",

The reader has more control over the story and the characters, while the viewer of a movie is at the mercy of the director and actors.   \n",

       "3  Hey there, little buddy! So, there's this cool kid named Kaleem who's eight years old and he has some really big hands! Like, they're so big that they weigh more than two stones! Can you imagine having hands that big? It's like having two big melons for hands! 😲\\n\\nKaleem was born with hands that were twice as big as other babies, and they've just kept growing. Now, his hands are so big that he has trouble doing simple things like tying his shoelaces or holding a pen. It's like his hands are too big for his body! 🤯\\n\\nThe doctors in India where Kaleem lives are really confused by his big hands. They've never seen anything like it before! They think it might be a rare condition called lymphangioma or hamartoma, but they're not sure. They want to do more tests to figure out what's going on. 🤔\\n\\nKaleem's parents are really worried about him. They want to help him have a normal life, but they don't have enough money to take him to the best doctors. They're trying to raise money to get him the help he needs. 💰\\n\\nSo, that's the story about Kaleem and his big hands! It's a pretty cool and strange thing, isn't it? 😮   \n",

Additionally, advancements in technology enabled more efficient food production and heightened consumer expectations for food transparency. Food delivery services also became increasingly popular, leading to new entrants into the food industry. Finally, the spread of the novel coronavirus caused a significant disruption to the food industry, with many restaurants and food businesses forced to temporarily close or radically alter their operations. \\n\\nOverall, the food industry in 2020 faced challenges but also saw many opportunities to become more sustainable, efficient, and transparent.   \n",

       "3  An eight-year-old boy has left doctors baffled after his hands swelled to giant proportions and now weigh more than two stone. Young Kaleem, from India, is unable to carry out simple tasks, including tying his own shoe laces, after he was born with hands twice the size of an average baby. His mother Haleema, 27, said she knew he was different at birth but was powerless to help and the youngster's hands have now grown so large they measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the end of his middle finger. Scroll down for video. Kaleem, from India, was born with hands twice the size of an average baby and they have continued to grow. His hands now measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the tip of his middle finger and weigh two stone. The eight-year-old claims he is bullied because of his giant hands and has difficulty performing simple tasks. The cricket fan said he has been bullied and shunned most of his life because others are 'scared' of his deformity. He said: 'I do not go to school because the teacher says other kids are scared of my hands. 'Many of them used to bully me for my deformity. They would say \"let's beat up the kid with the large hands\". 'Some of them have actually beaten me and would go after me often. 'I find it difficult to put on my clothes, button my shirt and pull up my pants. 'But I don't know if I want doctors to operate on my hands. They would have to make me unconscious and then they would cut me open. 'I have no problem if they could do it without an injection. A small operation would be okay.' His parents, who earn just £15 a month, have been desperately trying to find help for their son - but to no avail. His mother Haleema, 27, (pictured with Kaleem and another one of her children) said she feels 'powerless' Kaleem, a keen cricketer, said the teachers at his school have told him other children are 'scared' of his hands. He has found it difficulty to play cricket and hold a bat due to his condition but tries to still join in with his friends. His mother, who has other children who do not suffer from the same condition, said: 'When Kaleem was born his hand was twice the size of a normal baby's. 'His hands were big and his fingers were long. Initially his fists were small but they began to grow large as well and his fingers also kept growing.' His father, Shamim, 45, who works as a labourer, is worried his son will never be independent and blames himself for not earning enough money. 'He has difficulty feeding himself because his fist does not bend properly - so we have to feed him,' he said. 'Using two fingers he is able to pick up some things like a glass of water to drink. 'We want to take him to the hospital but there have been times when money has been so low that my wife has been forced to go begging. 'In that kind of financial situation, getting treatment for Kaleem was difficult. 'Even when I tried to get Kaleem into the school, the headmaster told me to put in writing that the school would not be responsible if the other children were afraid of his hands or bullied him or laughed at him.' Doctors in India have been left baffled by his growing hands and many are at a loss as to what the condition is. The youngster has difficulty eating, tying his shoelaces and carrying out other basic tasks due to his  hands. Kaleem's father Shamim, 45, (pictured together above) is worried his son will never become independent. The couple have only just been able to take their son to a local doctor for an assessment but their hopes of an instant cure have been dashed. Dr Ratan, the director of the local hospital, said: 'As far as my knowledge goes, this is an extremely rare condition. 'I have not seen a case in medical journals or on the internet where only the hands grew to such a large size. 'Until we have done proper genetic testing we will not be able to say exactly what is causing this deformity.' He said that apart from the unsightly growths, Kaleem is in good health - with properly functioning lungs and heart. Doctors have assessed Kaleem and have described his hands as a 'rare condition'. He is otherwise healthy. Kaleem was born with larger-than-average hands but they have continued to grow throughout his childhood. But as his hands continue to grow it may put increased pressure on his cardiovascular system, potentially shortening his life. Elsewhere, Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at the state-of-the-art Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, near Delhi, has also been left baffled after reviewing photographs and videos of the boy's hands. However, he believes Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma or hamartoma - which are both treatable. He added: 'This condition looks very rare and I have come across something like this before. Without proper examination and medical tests I am not 100 per cent sure about what this is.' Kaleem's parents are now hoping to raise money for their son in the hope that his condition can be treated. One doctor said he believes the Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma - a condition of the lymphatic system causing extreme inflamation - or hamartoma - a benign tumour - both of which are treatable. Lymphangioma is a condition of the lymphatic system which causes extreme inflammation resulting in doughy masses forming in certain parts of the body. Hamartoma is a benign type of tumour where the body produces excess tissue. After hearing from the doctors, Kaleem's parents now have renewed optimism that something can be done for their son and are doubling their efforts to raise money for him. 'We have tried several places with no solutions so far,' said Shamim. 'But I have a feeling there is a way to get the resources to give my son a normal life.'\\nSummarize the highlights of this article.   \n",
